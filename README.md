### Algorithm
1) Parsing and building all (with groups) trees
2) Resolving Nodes Tree into DomElements tree with modificators

####Aggregators: ```>, ^, +, *```
Used for chainable tree building. Defines child, parent and sibling elements relations.

####Modificators: ```.class#id{content}```
Defines modification of current element: multiplication and elements descriptions (attributes, content etc.).
